# DeltaScore

Welcome to **DeltaScore: Fine-Grained Story Evaluation with Perturbations**, which has been published in [EMNLP2023](https://2023.emnlp.org).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to propose a new methodology to conduct fine-grained story evaluation by differentiating perturbations.
We have demonstrated that DeltaScore can outperform evaluation methods that use likelihood directly, and you can find the details in our [published paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08991).
